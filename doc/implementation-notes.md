# Gravity and Orbits - Implementation Notes

This document contains notes that will be helpful to developers and future maintainers of this simulation.

## Structure

This sim is structured in an atypical way as a result of being a direct port from a Java sim and due to the fact that it
has 4 "modes" for each screen.

The GravityAndOrbitsScreenView file takes as an argument a GravityAndOrbitsModule object instead of a model as is
typical. There is one module object for each screen. Each module object has 4 GravityAndOrbitsMode objects associated
with it. These modes represent the different planetary configurations (sun + earth, earth + satellite, etc.). Each mode
has its own GravityAndOrbitsModel associated with it because the state of each of these models must be remembered
independently. The configuration for each mode can be found in the file ModeConfig.

## Memory Management

All observer/observable relationships exist for the lifetime of the sim. So there is no need to call the various
memory-management functions associated with objects (unlink, dispose, detach, etc.)
